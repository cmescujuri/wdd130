    <h2>Cassie Escujuri</h2>
    <h2>Cass</h2>
    <p>I'm 29 years old and live in a small town outside of Boise, Idaho. I recently returned from visiting northern Spain -- pictured above -- where my parents are serving their senior mission and where my Basque heritage hails from. Kaixo! The picture is me at Gaztelugatxe, where Game of Thrones did some filming, but is really a hermitage dedicated to John the Baptist.</p>
    <p>For five years, I was a lead medical assistant for a dermatologist in Boise. It was a small clinic that couldn't afford good IT professionals, so I filled the role of IT support whenever possible. I learned a lot and recognized my desire to pursue software development and web development as a career. I hope one day to help develop more efficient and user-friendly EMR technologies for healthcare professionals.</p>
    <p>I am single and have no children, but I love my 6 neices and nephews with all my heart; they bring me so much joy. I enjoy creative writing, reading, playing piano, staying active, and some online gaming in my free time.</p>
