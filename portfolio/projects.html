        <p>These two links were guided projects completed during my education through BYU Pathways. The first is an example of a web page with an image of BYU-Idaho campus and an inspirational quote. It was here that I began understanding the capacity that HTML and CSS could do while working together. The second project is a website for an imaginary white water rafting company called Dry Oar. Here is where I began to understand how wireframes are used to guide the construction of a webpage. I chose the color scheme based on the colors used in the company logo in order to create consistency across the website. The fonts were pulled in from Google fonts, since this was a school project that did not require the student to purchase fonts. I tried to use headline fonts that were easy to read and showed a bit of character and adventure. The paragraph fonts were more polished with the effort to keep them easy to read while still contrasting from the easy-going feeling of the headline fonts.</p>
