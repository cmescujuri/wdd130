            <p>The site will also contain an introduction about myself, and where I come from. I was born in 1994 and grew up moving to different states quite a bit due to my father's love for flipping homes. After college, I was a medical assistant for several years before switching my career to become a web developer. I do not regret the time I spent in the medical field, as I will be using the experiences that I gained to further my career in web development. If the opportunities arise, I would love to work for an online medical electronic records company to help create more efficient and user-friendly experiences for workers in the medical field. Many healthcare professionals are from older generations that do not understand technology to the extent that the developers do. Having worked with those older generations, I plan to bring their perspectives to my future developer coworkers so that their concerns can be heard. A summary of my resume will also be available on my site. This will include my first bachelor's degree in biology earned through BYU-Idaho in 2018, along with the several years of work experience as a medical assistant working with and troubleshooting electronic medical records systems. I did not go into the position as lead medical assistant at Boise Dermatology with the intent to troubleshoot the technology in the office; however, the role of troubleshooting found me. It was there that I realized my passion for technology and the passion I once had to pursue technology as my lifelong career. From there, I started my journey through BYU Pathways and BYU-Idaho to earn my second bachelor's degree in software development with an emphasis in web development.</p>
